The following CSS code snippet demonstrates a scenario where an unexpected behavior might occur due to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.container div {
  background-color: lightgreen;
}

#myDiv {
  background-color: yellow;
}

#myDiv.container {
  background-color: lightcoral; /*This will override other styles */
}

```

The intended behavior might be that only `#myDiv` will have a background color of yellow, but because of the specificity of `#myDiv.container`, the element with the ID "myDiv" that also has the class "container" will override this color, making it lightcoral instead.
